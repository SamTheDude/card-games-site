## Frequently Asked Questions

#### What sort of card games do you play?
We play a wide variety of card games catering for all abilities.
Some of the games we play include Bridge, Speed, Whist, Spoons, Cribbage and Irish Snap. 
We sometimes play alternative card games such as Uno and Cards Against Humanity. 
You don’t have to play the games we introduce, if you have a game
you want to play then feel free to teach us or play your own variations.

#### When do you meet?
We hold weekly meetings, generally on a Sunday evening in the Students Union. We also hold regular socials.
If you have other commitments from time to time don't worry as there's no obligation to come every week.

#### Do you play games where gambling is involved?
In line with the Students Union Policy, we do not hold our own gambling events.
From time to time however, we do organise events at third party venues where gambling is permitted.
We make it very clear that on these occasions there is absolutely no pressure
for anyone to gamble if they do not wish to do so.
Throughout the year we do hold charity tournaments and competitions
where prizes (cash and non-cash) can be won.

#### I don't know many card games, do you teach us?
That's absolutely fine! Nearly all of us will come across at least one game we haven't played at some point.
We cater for all abilities and will teach you any games we play.

#### Why do we pay a membership fee?
To cover the costs of the refreshments at the weekly meetings, discounted socials, buying equipment and other society costs, our membership fee is £5 for the year.
